EngageCRM
EngageCRM is a scalable customer engagement platform built for marketing and communication teams. It provides powerful campaign management, intelligent customer segmentation, and background delivery pipelines (via RabbitMQ) to ensure reliable message delivery at scale.

Features
Campaign Management – Create, queue, and track campaigns with filters and logic (AND/OR).
Customer Segmentation – Filter customers by spend, visits, or inactivity.
Background Processing – Asynchronous delivery using RabbitMQ + worker processes.
Vendor Integration – Unified API layer to send SMS/WhatsApp/Email via third-party vendors.
Logs & Analytics – Track campaign delivery, success, and failures.
Authentication – Secure routes with NextAuth (Google OAuth, Credentials).
Scalable Architecture – Decoupled ingestion/delivery flows for high throughput.
